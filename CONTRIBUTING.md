## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-nautobot.git
cd mcp-nautobot

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep line length to 88 characters (Black's default)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common test data
- Mock external API calls to Nautobot
- Test both success and error cases

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from mcp_nautobot_server.nautobot_client import NautobotClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_ip_addresses_success(mock_nautobot_response):
    """Test successful IP address retrieval."""
    client = NautobotClient(config)
    result = await client.get_ip_addresses(prefix="10.0.0.0/8")
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert all(ip.address.startswith("10.") for ip in result)
```

### Documentation

- Update the README for new features
- Add docstrings to all new functions and classes
